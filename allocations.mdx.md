The allocation feature is a brand-new feature to Planpoint. It allows you to assign limited access to floors and units for preferred people, whether it is VIP brokers working on your project or even stakeholders.
By using this feature, you will be able to create a custom Planpoint with the attributed units for a specific person that will require a password in order to access it.
