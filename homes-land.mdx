The **Homes & Land** option lets you choose between one of three models:

- a typical image (i.e. money-shot rendering or a bird's eye view)
- an interactive SVG
- custom polygons direclty on our native map

### Interactive SVG

To use the interactive SVG model, you need to follow a few important requirements when exporting your file.

1. All selectable elements must grouped together under one group.
2. This group must have a unique ID.
3. Each element under this group must have it's own unique ID.
