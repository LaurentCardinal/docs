The **Homes & Land** option lets you choose between one of three models:

1. A typical image (i.e. money-shot rendering or a bird's eye view)
2. An interactive SVG
3. Custom polygons directly on our native map

### Interactive SVG

To use the interactive SVG model, you need to follow a few important requirements when exporting your file.

- All selectable elements must grouped together under one group.
- This group must have a unique ID.
- Each element under this group must have it's own unique ID.
