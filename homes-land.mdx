The **Homes & Land** option lets you choose between one of three models:

1. A regular image (i.e. money-shot rendering or a bird's-eye view)
2. An interactive SVG
3. Custom polygons directly on our native map

### Regular image

You can map your homes and plots of land to any type of image. In a **Homes & Land project**, you don't draw polygons on top of floors - _there's no concept of floors_ - but directly on the home itself or the land itself.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Second Card">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Interactive SVG

To use the interactive SVG model, you need to follow a few important requirements when exporting your file.

- All selectable elements must grouped together under one group.
- This group must have a unique ID.
- Each element under this group must have it's own unique ID.
