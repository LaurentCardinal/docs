## Endpoints

The Planpoint API features endpoints for every common items of the Planpoint Viewer.

```JavaScript
api.schedule(function(done) {
  performCalculations();
  done();
}, "when-idle");
```

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.
