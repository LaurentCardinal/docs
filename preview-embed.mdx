  <Info>Assign a permanent namespace and project name before embedding the code. If these are modified, the code will cease to function, necessitating the need for re-embedding.</Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    A new window will open up with the live preview of your current project. Test your plan viewer and make changes accordingly. You will need to reload the preview in order for changes to take effect.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4">
    Once you're satisfied with your plan viewer, simply select the desired language **output** and **theme**, and click on **Click to copy**.
    - You can export as many instances of your plan viewer as you wish, in 5 languages (French, English, Spanish, Chinese and German). Each language will have a different code to copy.
    - You should paste the code wherever you want your plan viewer to appear in your website. The plan viewer will fill the parent element in which it's inserted. The code will work on every major website platform, from Wordpress to Wix and custom HTML.
