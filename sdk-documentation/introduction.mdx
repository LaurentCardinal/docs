## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## React components

The Planpoint SDK is sending pre-configured React components that allow for easy rendering. It requires the ID of a project that has previously been configured in the dashboard. Loading a project looks like this:


```JavaScript JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Project id="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

You can also load a single unit like this:

```JavaScript JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Unit } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Unit projectId="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" unitName="202" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```
