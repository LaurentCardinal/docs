Planpoint SDK, or software development kit, offers a collection of tools for developers to integrate Planpoint interfaces to their custom web projects. With a few lines of code, you can enhance your project with interactive and modern user experiences.

The Planpoint SDK facilitates rendering by serving **pre-configured React components** that allow easy integration. In this section, we will provide general information on how to configure our SDK to implement Plainpoint interfaces into your JavaScript software.

## Getting Started 

In your React project, begin by importing all components of Planpoint SDK:

```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
```

You can alternatively import individual components at a time. For example, importing the project component:

```JavaScript
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
```

## Planpoint Views

The Plainpoint SDK provides a set of views ready to integrate to your websites. Plainpoint will serve ready-to-use graphical components, while handling all processing and data management. 

There are four core views which can be rendered via the SDK. Letâ€™s have a look at them and their corresponding integrations.

**1. Project View**

The project view provides a list of current projects with relevant data, including the area, occupancy, price, and others. Integrating the project view in your project  requires the ID of a project that has previously been configured in the dashboard. Loading a project looks like this:

```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Project id="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

Check out the result:

<Frame type="glass">

</Frame>

You can also load a single unit like this:

```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Unit } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Unit projectId="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" unitName="202" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

**2. Group View**

The group view allows to inspect individual groups with their corresponding data, including the number of bedrooms, occupancy, status, and others. In a similar way as presented above, you can integrate a group view into your project.

Group views share the exact listener configuration with project views - the single difference being the nature of the entity that's passed in _stage_ and _entity_ events. Instead of passing floor ids to _stage_ and _entity_ events, Group Views will pass project ids instead.

Here's how it looks:

## Event Management

Each view rendered with the SDK provides a unique list of events and triggers. You can pass a listener configuration to each component from planpoint-sdk/core to listen for and respond to said events.

Project views provide different kinds of events:

1. _stage_ events will listen to events across the image displayed on the right. There's a _hover_ and _click_ event for the floors displayed on the project. Each event will carry the id of the floor in scope.
2. _filter_ events will fire whenever users click any of the available filter dropdowns along with filters hidden in the _filter_ menu. Each filter event will carry the name of the filter, the previous value as well as the new value. 
3. _view_ events will fire whenever users toggle full screen, grid or list view. Each event will carry the name of the previous and current view. 
4. _entity_ events will fire whenever users _hover_ over or _click_ any of the entities listed in the table on the right of the screen. Each event will carry the id of the entity in scope. 

Example listener configuration for a project view:

```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const handleStageHover = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleStageClick = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleFilter = ({ name, valueBefore, valueAfter }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleViewSwitch = ({ oldView, newView }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleListHover = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleListClick = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const listenerConfig = {
        stage: {
                hover: handleStageHover,
                click: handleStageClick
}, filter: {
},
click: handleFilter,
        view: {
                click: handleViewSwitch,
}, entity: {
                hover: handleListHover,
                click: handleListClick
} }
const app = <Project id="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" listeners=
{listenerConfig} />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```
