<Note>
  If you're looking for a simple connection between your software and Planpoint, you can look into our [API](/api-documentation/introduction).
</Note>

Planpoint SDK, or software development kit, offers a collection of tools for developers to integrate Planpoint interfaces to their custom web projects. With a few lines of code, you can enhance your project with interactive and modern user experiences.

The Planpoint SDK facilitates rendering by serving pre-configured React components that allow easy integration. In this section, we will provide general information on how to configure our SDK to implement Plainpoint interfaces into your JavaScript software.

## React components

The Planpoint SDK is sending pre-configured React components that allow for easy rendering. It requires the ID of a project that has previously been configured in the dashboard. Loading a project looks like this:


```JavaScript JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Project id="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

You can also load a single unit like this:

```JavaScript JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Unit } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Unit projectId="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" unitName="202" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

## Event management

An example listener configuration looks like this:

```JavaScript JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const handleStageHover = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleStageClick = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleFilter = ({ name, valueBefore, valueAfter }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleViewSwitch = ({ oldView, newView }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleListHover = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleListClick = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const listenerConfig = {
        stage: {
                hover: handleStageHover,
                click: handleStageClick
}, filter: {
},
click: handleFilter,
        view: {
                click: handleViewSwitch,
}, entity: {
                hover: handleListHover,
                click: handleListClick
} }
const app = <Project id="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" listeners=
{listenerConfig} />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

## Misc.

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [M components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.
