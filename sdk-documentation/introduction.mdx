Planpoint SDK, or software development kit, offers a collection of tools for developers to integrate Planpoint interfaces to their custom web projects. With a few lines of code, you can enhance your project with interactive and modern user experiences.

The Planpoint SDK facilitates rendering by serving **pre-configured React components** that allow easy integration. In this section, we will provide general information on how to configure our SDK to implement Plainpoint interfaces into your JavaScript software.

## Getting Started 

In your React project, begin by importing all components of Planpoint SDK:

```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
```

You can alternatively import individual components at a time. For example, importing the project component:

```JavaScript
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
```





The Planpoint SDK is sending pre-configured React components that allow for easy rendering. It requires the ID of a project that has previously been configured in the dashboard. Loading a project looks like this:


```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Project id="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

You can also load a single unit like this:

```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Unit } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const app = <Unit projectId="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" unitName="202" />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```

## Event management

An example listener configuration looks like this:

```JavaScript
import * as Planpoint from 'planpoint-sdk';
import { Project } from 'planpoint-sdk/core';
const handleStageHover = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleStageClick = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleFilter = ({ name, valueBefore, valueAfter }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleViewSwitch = ({ oldView, newView }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleListHover = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const handleListClick = ({ floorId }) => { /* ... */ }
const listenerConfig = {
        stage: {
                hover: handleStageHover,
                click: handleStageClick
}, filter: {
},
click: handleFilter,
        view: {
                click: handleViewSwitch,
}, entity: {
                hover: handleListHover,
                click: handleListClick
} }
const app = <Project id="602e27b829f590001f83a5a2" listeners=
{listenerConfig} />
const renderContext = Planpoint.createRenderContext();
await renderContext.render(app);
```
