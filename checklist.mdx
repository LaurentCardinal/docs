### Property Images

You need one or many rendering(s) of your project. It cand also be a photo or many phots of your building. The required format is JPG. The maximum weight is 1MB, anything under is better. Images should not exceed 1000px horizontally.

+ Use your top money-shot for this image
+ If you have a multi-phase project, use a bird's eye-view of the project as a whole for the group image. View example.
+ If you wish to use our 360Â° project feature, gather a the best shots from all around the building.

<Tip>**PRO TIP:** Vertical images will look better than horizontal images, just like the one below:</Tip>
