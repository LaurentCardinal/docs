### Property Images

You need one or many rendering(s) of your project. It cand also be a photo or many phots of your building. The required format is JPG. The maximum weight is 1MB, anything under is better. Images should not exceed 1000px horizontally.

- Use your top money-shot for this image
- If you have a multi-phase project, use a bird's eye-view of the project as a whole for the group image. [View example here.](https://www.planpoint.io/types/rentals)
- If you wish to use our [360° project feature](https://www.planpoint.io/new-releases/360-project), gather all the best shots from all around the building.

<Tip>**PRO TIP:** Vertical images will look better than horizontal images, just like the one below:</Tip>
