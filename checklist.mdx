### Cloud folder

The first thing you will need is a folder where you can save all the necessary content at the same place.

### Property Images

You need one or many rendering(s) of your project. It cand also be a photo or many phots of your building. The required format is JPG. The maximum weight is 1MB, anything under is better. Images should not exceed 1000px horizontally.

- Use your top money-shot for this main image.
- If you have a multi-phase project, use a bird's eye-view of the project for the group image. [View example here.](https://www.planpoint.io/types/rentals)
- If you wish to use our [360Â° project feature](https://www.planpoint.io/new-releases/360-project), gather all the best shots from all around the building.

<Tip>**PRO TIP:** Vertical images will look better than horizontal images, just like the one below:</Tip>

### Floors

The floor plates for all floors of your building. Each of them need to be separated for each floor and saved in JPG format. Consider adding the following elements to provide a better experience to your clients:

- Compass
- Landscaping
- Parking area
- Streets and directions
- Nature features like rivers, mountains, etc.
- Design cleaned out of construction or architectural details

Here's a good example:

</Frame>

### Unit layouts

All unit layout plans must be created in two versions: 

- **One JPG version** for the plan viewer. This is the first thing you see while looking at a specific unit.
- **One PDF version** for the download PDF button on every unit page.

<Info>When units span more than one floor, the **PDF** can be saved with multiple pages, but the **JPG** version of the same unit must be separated into multiple images - they will appear as a gallery.</Info>

</Frame>

### Unit list

You must have your unit list with all important information such as unit number, size, number of bedrooms, price, availability, occupancy dates, etc.

<Tip>**PRO TIP:** We provide a [template that you can download](https://app.planpoint.io/assets/template.xlsx) and use as the basis for your unit list.</Tip>

Please view the video below to understand how to setup the proper format.

### Optional content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Interior renderings and images" icon="image">
      Planpoint allows you to add images in a gallery in JPG format. Please resize your images to max 1800px horizontally and no more than 1MB per image. Images that are compressed will load faster for your clients. We recommend using free tools such as TinyJPG and Squoosh.

      Here's some ideas of what you can display:
      - interiors of units like kitchen, bathroom, dining room.
      - bedroom exterior views from the point of view of each unit
      - common areas

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3D tours" icon="cube">
    Planpoint allows you to add 3D tours for each units in your project. We offer two different technologies for this. The base 3D tour is the one you see below, which 3D artists can create in any typical rendering software.

    The second one is the [next-gen 3D tour](https://www.planpoint.io/new-releases/next-gen-3d-tours) which allows for measurements, dynamic elements and choice of finishes.
    
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Amenities" icon="water-ladder">
    You can also include renderings or photos of your amenities such as the pool, the terrace, the interior courtyard and use our **Amenities** feature to showcase them.
